(common for all messages)

#### Request format

```
  {
    app:<app> //Module - to avoid request name conflicts
    command:<command> //Command
    request_id:<request_id> //Optional - to identify responses.
    …
    arg:<arg>
    …
  }
```
Here and further denoted as `<app>.<command>(…,<arg>,…)`.

#### Replies and notifications

(just a redux command)
```
  {
    type: //Action type
    request_id: //Only if request had a request_id.
    …
    arg:<arg>
    …
  }
```
Here and further denoted as `<type>(…,<arg>,…)`.

A *reply* is a message generated by server as an immediate reaction
to a request. A *notification* is also generated by server, but doesn't
correspond to a specific request, therefore notifications canot have
`request_id`.

#### Generated replies
* `INVALID_REQUEST(message)` - only generated when request_id is present.

# questions
#### Supported requests
* `questions.subscribe(classroom)`
* `questions.post_question(classroom,text)`

#### Generated notifications
* `ADD_QUESTION(data)`
